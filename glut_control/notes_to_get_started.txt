1.  checkout the branch:  git checkout bobby
2.  goal 1:  trace through the code in gnn_starter.py (can use gnn_starter.sh); try to
    understand what's going on.
3.  goal 2:  any work with GNNs in the code is currently done with
    gnn_model_zero from resolution_prebuffer.py

    This is pseudo_gnn class that, e.g., doesn't do any message
    passing.  Can we get this to work with a GNN from the library?
    The first test of this will be to repliace the supervised learning
    task in gnn_starter.py
