1.   Go over Q-learning algortihm, look for mistakes (maybe dones?)
1.1  Add new things to wandb:
	number of actions (testing)
	size of heap (testing)
	estimated q-values for current
	estimated q-values for target
1.2:  modify algorithm
      a.  now that we're sorting kbs/actions in rl portion, should sort them
      in base model training as well
2.   Create a quick and dirty way to reload alma so we can run q-learning for
a week.
3.   Look at using all the features from the transformer rather than just the
[cls] token; problem is that this is variable length, and the self-attention
means different things on different steps.
